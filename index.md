Data mining and machine learning methods constitute the core of data science. This course introduces the concepts and theory of knowledge discovery, data mining and machine learning. It will cover the fundamentals of statistical learning methods from exploratory data analysis, unsupervised learning to supervised learning and other learning methods to uncover the patterns and structure of data targeting predictive analytics. Specific modeling methods include regression analysis, classification, logistic models, non-linear models, decision tree, association rules, neural network and support vector machines. New developments in learning such as deep learning and interpretable machine learning will also be introduced and illustrated.
